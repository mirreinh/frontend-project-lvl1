## About
Brain Games is my educational project that I performed during the studying on <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/EPMljQnbq47E8Mf4QmWioVjOq">hexlet.io</a> (project level 1).

Brain Games is a set of five console-games. Each game asks questions expecting right answers back. Three right answers mean that game is passed. Wrong answers finish game and suggest trying it again.

**Games**:
* Calculator. Do some simple calculations.
* Progression. Find skipped element in sequence of numbers.
* Conclude whether given number is even or not.
* Find the greatest common divisor of given numbers.
* Conclude whether given number is prime or not.

**Example**:
```
May I have your name: Mir
Hello, Mir!
What number is missing in the progression?
Question: 38 43 48 .. 58 63
Your answer: 53
Correct!
Question: 44 47 50 .. 56 59
Your answer: 53

Question: 23 27 31 .. 39 43 47 51
